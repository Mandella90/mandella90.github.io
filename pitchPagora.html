    <p class="headline">
    Pagora is the working title for a video streaming/sharing service. The idea is that if you create a Spree account, that same account will allow you to login to Pagora. This felt like an easy backdoor sort of strategy to create a new video sharing service. The reasons are the same as for creating a new social media platform: no censorship, no favoritism, freedom of speech etc.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>basics</h2>
    <p class="post">
    The basics of Pagora are for it to run much like Youtube. Spree 'users,' as well as Spree 'pages,' will be able to post videos.  The reason for allowing pages to post videos, is to encourage record labels, production companies etc. to post their videos here, with the knowledge that we can more easily protect their copyrighted property. Again, because the service will be cracking down on bots, there's some confidence we can place in video publishers that copyrighting will be more easily policed.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: #61c161; font-weight: bold;">streaming</h2>
    <p class="post">
    This is where my pitch seperates from others. I believe it's inevitable that some day people will be able to pick which specific channels the subscribe to. Cable is already struggling. People are sick of having 3 different subscriptions, just to watch the few shows they like, and still get live sports. The most important channels to get will be live sport channels. Obviously!  The rest might HAVE to follow.
    <br><br>
    With a large enough user base, and the cut down on bots, it makes it a much more risky proposition for users to share streams illegally. This should create incentive for traditional cable programs to join Pagora.
    </p>
    <h2>pay per view</h2>
    <p class="post">
    Being the sole provider of a promotion's pay-per-view content will allow us to provide them with a key benefit.  An easy to use piracy safeguard. It works like this.. we view the illegal streams themselves while they are happening. Then during a commercial break, or stop in the action, subtly display EVERY users username on their screen. Perhaps in the corner of the screen. Then we know who's stream to turn off. After we're proven right, we can suspend their account, and given the nature of how hard it is to create new user accounts on the platform, deter future illegal streamers.     
    </p>
    <h2>rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can turn their screen off and still have Pagora playing</li>
        <li>There are probably more rules, but I want something to turn in lol.</li>
    </ul>
