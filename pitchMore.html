 <h2>replacing cell phone service providers</h2>
 <p class="post">
    The idea here is to go from cell phone providers to an internet provider. Maybe even Starlink.  It could be done by giving Spree members a unique 16-or-so character ID, that they can be used on Spree's 'messenger'-like app.  This becomes much more reasonable a proposition after asking users for their SSNs, to make sure we avoid the bot/fakeusers issue.  This could also create incentive for cellphone providers to create more generic, jailbroken-like devices.
    <br>
 </p>
 <h2>polling</h2>
 <p class="post">
    It could be interesting having polls done through a SpreeNews page. Having these same polls taken through an unadulterated process from bots.  Ask more poignant questions than simply what's topical.  Questions about the Federal Reserve, hedge funds, or the potential powers of Google.  This type of information could be leveraged and parlayed into some real change.
 </p>
 <h2>cable a la carte</h2>
 <p class="post">
     I've already covered this in 'Pagora,' but I'd just like to emphasise, again, the importance in keeping the ad revenue away from Spree. The more ads are kept away from the social media, the more trusted.
</p>
<h2>pagora's comedy kickoff</h2>
<p class="post">
    The idea here is to stream a live show from your buddy Joe Rogan's new stand up comedy store, at about the same time Spree is made public. Given the nature of your relationship, I'm sure he would go along with it, and it would make for an epic night. I have ideas of standups in mind, but I'm sure he'd rather choose.
</p>
<h2>scalper remover</h2>
<p class="post">
    The idea here is that companies like Newegg or Nike, could require the use of a Spree account in order to prevent scalpers from buying up all of their product the second it drops.  This would be made possible by the fact that Spree doesn't allow multiple accounts or bots.  The companies themselves would also have to only allow 1 purchase per account.
</p>
<h2>pegasus fighter</h2>
<p class="post">
    If we could move people off of cellphones and onto pure internet/starlink type communication, it could become easier to defend people from Pegasus Spyware technology, which seems to only be used on Android and IOS devices.
