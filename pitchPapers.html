    'The Papers,' will make up the right-container of Spree, and be built similarly to Twitter's with more customization. User will be able to select which news sources they want highlighted, as well as which ones to avoid. News sources can pay to have their news source 'featured,' at the top of the selection list. If users choose not to customize their list, than those sources will be favorited over others. 
    <br><br>
    The reason it's name is 'The Papers,' is because I'd like for when users to click on a news source's name, for a pop-up window to show all their stories that day, in the form of an oldschool newspaper. Although this might be a harder feature to sell, I'm confident it would be well received, and used frequently. I also feel this is a great opportunity for Spree to have it's own brand in the news media world. I have names like Glenn Greenwald in mind, as well as many others, but I'll just end it here.
