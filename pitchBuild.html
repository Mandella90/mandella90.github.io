    <h2>what spree's made of</h2>
    <p class="post">
        There are four main components to this idea: social media (Spree), video sharing (Pagora), The Papers and apps.

    <h2>the look</h2>
    <p class="post">
        The look would be more along the lines of Twitter than Facebook. Most of the links that are in the left-container, I would move to the users profile page.  This leaves room for apps and an appstore to take their place. When visiting other user's profiles, I would put emphasis on just three things: pictures, videos, and posts; leaving out being able to see what posts that user has liked or replied to. The pictures and videos tabs would be laid out in a way similar to instagrams, which has it's own issues with bots that drives it's users crazy. This also creates an opportunity to take away from Instagrams user base. The right-container would remain much like how Twitter has it now, but with more customization. The idea for this can be found in 'The Papers' tab.
        <br><br>
        Because some people like to run specialized accounts for memes, art, politics etc., users can be admins on 'pages.' These will be different than user accounts.  The main difference here is that pages will not be able to 'like,' comment, or vote on someone elses posts. This is out of protection from an inflated narrative. A user can only be an admin on up to one page (maybe two), to keep Spree's junk posts to a minimum.
    </p>
    <h2>potential</h2>
    <p class="post">
        I would hope that the majority of revenue the project would bring, comes from apps and video streaming. This would keep user's feeds relatively unspoiled.
        <br><br>
        With an emphasis placed on apps, there is more ad revenue to be had. This, in turn, could help keep Spree from needing to spam feeds with as many ads as most social medias do.  The potential within the types of apps, and how popular they could be, is damn near limitless. It comes down to how good the ideas are, and how good the execution.
        <br><br>
        When it comes to video, the idea is to compete with Youtube for much of the same reason as to compete with social medias: censorship, favoritism etc.  Again, the possible ad revenue takes away from the ad revenue that otherwise would be needed on the social media side. Additional video streaming ideas you can find in the 'Pagora' section. There is also an easy path to creating a Spree news team, that can be highlighted on the platform.
        <br><br>
        The hardnosed approach on bots/fake users can't be stressed enough. Getting rid of that will give a much clearer picture of where Americans actually stand.      
    </p>
    <h2>rules and such</h2>
    <ul class="rules">
        <li>E-Mails and Cellphone numbers will be required to create a username. No duplicates of either will be allowed</li>
        <li>Posts can either be sent to 'private' or 'public,' depending on if you want only followers to see it, or all Spree users.</li>
        <li>Once a username is created, it can be used to login to Pagora as well.</li>
        <li>Profile's will have all setting set to private by default.</li>
        <li>There will be no cellphone notifications until a user actually opens the app. This is in an attempt to gain trust from users that we're not simply trying to steal their attention.</li>
        <li>Spree will start in 'dark' mode.</li>
        <li>I'd like Spree's primary colors to be blue & green.</li>
    </ul>
