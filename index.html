        Programmers are taught to be problem solvers. This is a sort of presentation on the obvious problems with the current social media landscape, along with solutions and some other big(ger) ideas to go with it.
        <br><br>
        This first page is about the easy fixes to be made to social media, and it's selling pionts. The tabs on the left are regarding the full vision of the project. They are in order, and with ideas on how to get the most out of it, while staying relatively basic.

        'Spree' is the working name for a new social media.

    <h2>problem</h2>
    <p class="post">
        There are 3 major problems with current social media landscape: bots, censorship, and curation.
        <br><br>
        - I think removing bots will prove to the most important step a social media company can take.  Bots can inflate a narative, do cyberattacks, buy out products before 'everyday' people have a chance to, commit fraud, give fake ratings and are just incredibly annoying. The best answer I have to this is requiring -and only allowing- one e-mail and cell phone number per user. In order to make sure the cell phone is a legitimate number, use a program like <ahref="https://www.freecarrierlookup.com/">CarrierLookup</a>.  The fact that it costs money to get a cell phone number would be a great deterrent to bot-makers. As well, it would double as a way to curb deviant behavior that results in suspensions. I could go on about the benefits of getting rid of bots, but I want to keep this as short as I can.
        <br><br>
        - The censorship issue is a simple one. Companies are private so they are not bound by the 1st amendment. This however, suggests they don't think the 1st amendment is a very good one in a country that demands it. Ironically, this kind of censorship has been pushed by the efforts of politicians.
        <br><br>
        - The issue with curation is a combination of censorship, bots, a goal of taking up users time, as well as a seeming favoritism towards certain news types.
    </p>

    <h2>selling points</h2>
    <ul class="rules">
        <li>A crackdown on bots/people with numberous accounts WILL prove to be most important.</li>
        <li>No censorship outside of: threats of violence, promotion of suicide & porn.</li>
        <li>With no bots, there will be no curation of trends or inflated naratives.</li>
        <li>No shadow banning, favoring or deplatforming.</li>
        <li>No data licensing, but perhaps making that type of information public through the service via a sort of easy to use SQL search.</li>
        <li>With the understanding that a user needs to input their phone number and e-mail, users will be less likely to push the rules, knowing that creating a new account would be such a hassle.</li>
    </ul>
